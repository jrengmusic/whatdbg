/**
 * @brief A responsible global context wrapper.
 *
 * Provides safe, explicit, and deterministic global access to a single live
 * instance of a given type without enforcing ownership. This allows global
 * reachability without turning the object into a true singleton.
 *
 * Design intent:
 * - Only one active instance of a given type is allowed at any time.
 * - Ownership remains explicit; lifetime is managed externally.
 * - Access is fail-fast and self-checking via jassert.
 * - Compile-time safety: ensures the derived class passes itself as the template parameter.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @code
 * struct Registry : Context<Registry>  // ✓ Correct: passes itself
 * {
 *     // your members...
 * };
 *
 * struct MyClass : Context<Registry>     // ✗ Error: should be Context<MyClass>
 * {
 *     // Compile error: Context<T> must be used with the derived class itself
 * };
 *
 * void setup()
 * {
 *     Registry registry;               // sets global context
 *     auto& ctx = Registry::getContext(); // safely access it
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam ObjectType The class type deriving from Context. MUST be the derived class itself.
